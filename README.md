# Web Scraping and SQL with Python
<!-- endhide -->

One way of getting Data to work on, is Web Scraping. This project was focused on scraping a website to get data, analyze it and store it in a SQL database

## 📒  Key Takes

Web Scraping is an essential tool to get data when the data is not fully availble to you. Using Pyhton and Beautiful Soup I was able to scrap information from a website to further analyze it. The key take is that the approach for web scraping varies a lot, plus you need to have in mind that Scraping has to be done in proper ways and legally to avoid trouble. Many platforms have scraping protections or strict rules about it, so always inform yourself before. 

Backing up the data to a SQL Database 🗄️ is always a good practice plus makes it easy to query whenever you need.
